Hello and thanks for downloading my Deviation Trainer program.

I came up with the idea to create this program while learning pandas to apply the knowledge I learned while working with pandas and to satisfy my want for a deviation trainer since I could not find one anywhere. Please note I was lazy when building the stats tables and didn't change all of them to the format I wanted to use(count value/correct answers/wrong answers) so if you look at your table statistics without encountering every cell just the count value will be present. If you look into the count_min_max.txt file the values are min,max and the max value will always be stored one more than the max count used in the program because of inclusivity.

If you would like to make any additions to the code or have an idea to make it better, send me an email at gavinpase@yahoo.com


If you get use out of this and would like to support me by donating you can by visiting paypal.me/gavinpase or don't. It's up to you.
